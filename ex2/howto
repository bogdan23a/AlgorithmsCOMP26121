How to write, compile, debug and run C programs on Linux
========================================================

There are some prompts below, but you should add anything else you think
will be useful.

Useful sources of information
=============================
-g
Produce debugging information in the operating system's native format (stabs, COFF, XCOFF,
           or DWARF 2).  GDB can work with this debugging information.

           On most systems that use stabs format, -g enables use of extra debugging information that
           only GDB can use; this extra information makes debugging work better in GDB but probably
           makes other debuggers crash or refuse to read the program.  If you want to control for
           certain whether to generate the extra information, use -gstabs+, -gstabs, -gxcoff+,
           -gxcoff, or -gvms (see below).

           GCC allows you to use -g with -O.  The shortcuts taken by optimized code may occasionally
           produce surprising results: some variables you declared may not exist at all; flow of
           control may briefly move where you did not expect it; some statements may not be executed
           because they compute constant results or their values are already at hand; some statements
           may execute in different places because they have been moved out of loops.

           Nevertheless it proves possible to debug optimized output.  This makes it reasonable to use
           the optimizer for programs that might have bugs.

           The following options are useful when GCC is generated with the capability for more than
           one debugging format.
-wall
 This enables all the warnings about constructions that some users consider questionable,
           and that are easy to avoid (or modify to prevent the warning), even in conjunction with
           macros.  This also enables some language-specific warnings described in C++ Dialect Options
           and Objective-C and Objective-C++ Dialect Options.

-o
-log-file=[file]
                  Copy to log file (standard input only).

-stc=c99
Sets the laguage standard to c99


Writing C programs
==================


Compiling C programs
====================
make nameOfExecutableProgam nameOfFileToCompile.c

Linking C programs
==================
LDFLAGS=-lm


Running C programs
==================
nameOfExecutableProgram arguments

Comparing output from C and Java programs
=========================================

they output the same thing but the mean in java is more accurate
